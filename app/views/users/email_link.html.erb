<strong>Three important suggestions when selecting a financial advisor:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Respond quickly to the advisors' phone calls and emails.
This will allow the advisor to speak with you and have a better understanding of the services that you are looking for. It will also give you the chance to set up an in-person appointment to interview the advisor.</li>

<li>Make sure to speak with each advisor before making a decision.
To ensure that you are selecting the best financial advisor, make sure to speak and meet with each advisor before making a final decision. Each advisor is different and can take a unique approach to your situation, so a careful review can reduce the chance of choosing an advisor based on an initial conversation. Focus on integrity, qualifications and professional skills.</li>

<li>Distance should not be the most important factor in your decision.
Don't limit yourself to choosing the advisor closest to your home; instead, base your decision on whether each advisor contacting you meets your expectations. Advisors are often willing to accommodate you when selecting meeting times and locations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we realize how important it is for you to choose an advisor that is truly an ideal fit, we have prepared some tips and guidelines for you to use when you are contacted by your selected advisors. These tips should help you to ask all the right questions and to make an informed, responsible choice.</p>

<p>"I just got connected to 3 very nice advisors here in north Tampa. I did not want to drive downtown and if I had not used this service I may not have realized I could connect with a planner so close to home & work. I am working mom and needed someone close. I plan to use one I was matched to.It really works!"
